                <span class="intro">This is some big text</span> to call attention to this paragraph.
                It contains only three sentences, but demonstrates something cool.
                When viewing on desktop and tablet, the paragraphs are separated with a line space.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is the second paragraph.
                If you view this text body on a mobile device, paragraphs are not separated by a line space.
                Instead, the paragraphs have an indent on the first line, like older typography.
                Arguably, this is a plus for UX!

            <h2>A Heading to Make Things Interesting</h2>
            <p>
                Here is a paragraph containing a <a href="https://github.com/nonproftechie/">link to something</a>.
                <code>
                    # It also contains code.<br />
                    print("Hello, world!")
                </code>
